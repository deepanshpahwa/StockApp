# StockApp - User Guide

This Android app is a way for users to come up with their own Finanicial Indicator by combining already exisiting
financial indicators with a mathematical function.

## What are financial indicators
Financial indicators are measures of performance of a stock. These financial indicators are crucial for an investor to forecast a stock's performance. For 
example, Moving Averages Convergence Divergence (MACD), a commonly used financial indicator, compares different moving averages of the stock and predicts
the performance depending on which moving average is higher. Another Financial indicator, Bollinger Bands, gives upper and lower bands for a stock such 
that when a stock price hits the upper band, it is unlikely to increase further and vice versa.

## Purpose of the app
The app allows the user to look for stocks and their current price. The user can favorite stocks that they want to follow and these stocks will appear on 
the startup page. On selecting a stock, the app prompts the user to select two or three finanical indicators and mathematical function(s). After selecting 
the appropriate box and clicking the 'Generate Financial Indiactor' button, the app opens up a new page consisting of 2 line graphs. The graph on the top is 
the value of the custom financial indicator vs the date and the graph on the bottom is of the price of the stock vs the date. Both these graphs show data of
the past three months. If the user finds this new financial indicator helpful, they can save this finanical indicator using a name.
